[Intro]
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a madman
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

[Chorus]
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

[Verse 2]
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

[Chorus]
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more (No)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
(Carry on) You will always remember
(Carry on) Nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely Heaven waits for you

[Chorus]
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
(Don't you cry) Don't you cry no more

[Outro]
No more
